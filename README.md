⋅⋅*Blockchain Integration: Utilization of Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts to secure transactions and ensure data immutability, enhancing trust and accountability in the supply chain.

**Technologies Used**
The project utilizes the following technologies to build and deploy the application:

⋅⋅*JavaScript: For client-side scripting and dynamic web content.
⋅⋅*MATLAB: For advanced data analysis and numerical computation related to crop health monitoring.
⋅⋅*CSS: For styling and layout of the web application, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface.
⋅⋅*HTML: For structuring the web pages and content.
⋅⋅*Solidity: For developing and deploying smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain to handle secure transactions and data management.

**Detailed Description**

**Supply Chain Tracking**
⋅⋅*The application provides comprehensive tools to track the agricultural supply chain, offering real-time updates on the movement and status of agricultural products. By integrating IoT sensors and blockchain technology, stakeholders can access transparent and reliable information, ensuring efficient supply chain management.

**Crop Health Monitoring**
⋅⋅*Leveraging IoT sensors, the application collects data on various environmental parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. MATLAB is used for processing and analyzing this data to provide actionable insights into crop health. This helps farmers make informed decisions to optimize irrigation, reduce resource usage, and improve crop yield.

**Blockchain Integration**
⋅⋅*The Ethereum blockchain and Solidity smart contracts form the backbone of the application's data integrity and security mechanisms. By recording transactions and data on a decentralized ledger, the application ensures that all information is tamper-proof and verifiable, enhancing trust among all participants in the agricultural supply chain.
